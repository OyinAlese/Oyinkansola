        <h1> Alese Zainob Oyinkansola</h1>
        <p> Hi, I'm Oyin! I hold a bachelor's degree in computer science and a certification in cybersecurity. For the past three years, I've been working as a product designer, combining creativity with problem-solving to build user-friendly products. Outside of work, I'm a big fan of movies, especially anything thought-provoking. I also enjoy reading, particularly sci-fi books, and I try to keep active by working out regularly. But, if I'm being honest, my favorite pastime is getting in some quality sleep—there's nothing quite like it!</p>
        <h2> My hobbies include;</h2>
